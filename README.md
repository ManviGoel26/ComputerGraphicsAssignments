# Computer Graphics Labs and Assignments
Assignments and Labs for the course Computer Graphics (CSE333) IIIT Delhi Monsoon 22


## Assignments
### 1. Shape Modelling. 
Render a surface using its parametric equation. 

### 2. Modelling, Viewing and Projection.
Rotate a camera in camera space using arrow keys and switch projections between perspective and orthogonal.

### 3. Lightning and Shading.
Add Gouraud and Phong shading using fragment shader.

### 4. Raytracing
Implement Blinn-Phong shading, shadows, recursive ray tracer and Transformed Primitives

### 5. Advanced Raytracing
Implement texture mapping for sphere and raytracing for implicit surface using their equations. 


## Labs
1. Render a Rectangle and cuboid using traingles in OpenGL
2. Rotate a cube for 2 radians per second
3. Move the camera vertically while looking at the same point and move the camera along a parabolic path.
4. Implement Gouraud and Phong Shading
5. Find the point of intersection for the Ray and Sphere.
6. Apply texture to the cube using texture coordinates.
7. Add Refraction and Schlicks Approximation for a Cubemap.   

## Instructions
For each assignment or lab code,

	cd code/src
	cmake ..
	make


This will generate the application file in the *code* folder.

Note:- If *cmake ..* gives an error, delete *CmakeCache.txt* from the *src* folder.
